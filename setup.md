## Requirements

You will requre 1) all the correct programs, 2) all the listed R packages 3) the dataset and code. Instructions for all these are below.


### Please see the attached document for program instructions: - [Program Install Instructions.docx](/Resources/install_instructions.docx)
-  R version: 3.6.x or newer (recommend 4.0.x) and RStudio

Once all of the programs are installed, open RStudio and run the below package install scripts. 

## Datasets and Code

There are four sets of data and code you will need for the ECR Workshop. Each corresponds to a lesson from a different presenter. 

Where the code is supplied as a ZIP archive, download it from the provided link and extract it to a location of your choice.

Where the code is supplied as a link to a Git repository, you have two options: 

1. If you are familiar with Git and its usage, then you may clone the repository to a location of your choice on your local machine using the `git clone [repository URL]` command. This requires some familiarity with Git, but will allow you to more easily incorporate updates to the code, should the instructor make them.

2. If you are not familiar with Git, then you can download the code as a ZIP archive and extract it to a location of your choice. This will make it slightly more cumbersome to update the code if the presenters make changes to it in the future, but it can be done without installing and setting up Git. 

Both options can be initiated by clicking the bright green `<> Code` button on the linked repository homepage. 

For **Jake Brownscombe's Telemetry With Machine Learning Workshop**, the code and data are available at [this repository.](https://github.com/jakebrownscombe/Telemetry_MachineLearning) When you have downloaded the archive, the code to be run can be found in the `worksheets/Telemetry_ML.R` file.

For **Ben Hlina's glatos Detection Efficiency Workshop**, the code and data are available at [this repository.](https://github.com/benjaminhlina/glatos-detection-efficiency/tree/main) When you have downloaded the archive, the code to be run can be found in the `R/glatos_detection_efficiency.R` file. 

For **Hugo Flavio's ACTEL workshop**, the code and data are available in [this ZIP archive.](/Resources/FLAVIO_2024_OTN_workshop.zip) When you have extracted the archive, the code to run is in the five R files in the main directory, numbered 00 to 04. 

Code for **Eric Pedersen's** workshop is still pending arrival.
