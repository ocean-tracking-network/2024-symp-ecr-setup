## 2024 OTN Symposium Early Career Researcher Workshops

This is a stub site meant to support the Early Career Researcher workshops at the 2024 OTN Symposium. There are four workshops, each of which requires a different set of code and data. You can find instructions to download the code on the [setup page](/2024-symp-ecr-setup/setup.html).

Additionally, each workshop has its own episode page for archival purposes that contains all the lesson material currently available to OTN, as well as the submitted abstract for he workshop.
