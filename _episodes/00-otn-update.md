This is a stub site meant to support the Early Career Researcher workshops at the 2024 OTN Symposium. There are four workshops, each of which requires a different set of code and data. You can find instructions to download the code on the [setup page](/2024-symp-ecr-setup/setup.html).

Presentation slides can be found at the following links. 

For the presentation slides from **Ben Hlina's workshop ('Estimating detection efficiency of acoustic receivers using glatos')**, [click here](/Resources/detection-effeicency-workshop.pptx).
